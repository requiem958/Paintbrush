#Paintbrush

##Introduction
Little project of an old game concept.
It is a game in 2D where players are painters and had to cover the biggest part of the map with their color.
As some persons says to me, it is similar to *Splatoon*.

##System Configuration

When it was working the program only needs the following libs to compile :

Libs needed :
-  sdl2
-  sdl2-image
-  sdl2-gfx
-  sdl2-net
-  sdl2-mixer
-  libconfig
  
Actually only sdl2 and sdl2-image are used.
You need to install them in system repository (Or edit Makefile).

##TODO

A little list of all i need to do.

- I need to fix the old code, remove all references to Painter struct
- Test if actually the program is working with the new data representation
- Think about using another language, because of the likewise ( Is it how we say "simili" in English ? ) Object representation used.
- Think about how the data structure should be used.
- Find a good design to the GUI
- Import the sprites and sounds
- Make this game great again ! (Bad joke, i feel bad)
